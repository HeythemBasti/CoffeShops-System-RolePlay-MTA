Command ARE:

PS : CHR-ID is the CHAR ID found in database in characters or you can get it by getElementData(player,"dbid")

for me i edited the scoreboard to show CHR-ID after username.

addsm CHR-ID.                                        -- adds sell marker

addstockm CHR-ID.                                        -- adds stock marker

ps : addstockm CHR-ID must be the same as addsm CHR-ID.

thisshop.                                        -- gets current shop ID

getallshops.                                        -- gets All shops in the server

delthisshop ID.                                        -- delete the shop with the ID

After doing the commands use restartres CoffeShops To apply the modifications.


you can get the database connection using
